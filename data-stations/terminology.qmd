## The Personal Health Train architecture
We take the Personal Health Train (PHT) architecture as our starting point [@boninodasilvasantos2022personal], wherein a Data Station is defined as a software application primarily responsible for making data and its associated metadata available to users under conditions determined by applicable regulations and Data Controllers. The main concepts are shown in @fig-pht-roles-components, while the various types of trains are shown in @fig-pht-train-types. A glossary of the concept is provided in @sec-glossary.

High-level overview of the Personal Health Train (PHT) architecture
:::

In their paper @boninodasilvasantos2022personal continu to describe more details of the PHT architecture including i) the various functions, services, interface and internal components of the data station; ii) the data visiting process; and iii) the data staging concept in the case data access has been authorized, but the station is not capable of executing the train and needs to stage a capable station with enough resources to run the train. We will consider these details later.

As an aside, it is good to mention that the authors of the PHT architecture have initiated the development of two specifications after publication of this paper, namely:

- [FAIR Data Point](https://specs.fairdatapoint.org/fdp-specs-v1.2.html) specification, which covers only the metadata and catalog part of the PHT architecture; 
- the [FAIR Data Train](https://specs.fairdatatrain.org/) specification, which covers the full scope of the original paper but at the time of writing is still incomplete.

## Mapping PHT to the DSSC Blueprint 2.0
To arrive at consistent conceptualization of data stations and trains, @tbl-mapping-pht-dssc maps the PHT architecture to the DSSC Blueprint 2.0 (DSB2). Some mappings are relatively evident. For example, the concept of Data and Metadata as defined in PHT is subsumed in the concept of a Data Product in DSB2. Less evident, is the mapping of the notion of a Train that '... represents the way data consumers interact with the data available in the Data Stations. Trains represent a particular data access request and, therefore, each train carries information about who is responsible for the request, the required data, what will be done with the data, what it expects from the station, etc.' to Value Creation Services in DSB2 that includes data fusion and enrichment, collaborative data analytics and federated learning. We tentatively conclude that it is possible to have a consistent conceptual mapping between, at least at the high level, of the PHT architecture into DSB2. We will return to this matter, when more detailed functions and technical standards are considered for the Archimate specification.

: Mapping the key concepts from the PHT architecture [@boninodasilvasantos2022personal] to the [concepts of the DSSC Blueprint 2.0](https://dssc.eu/space/BVE2/1071252161/Alphabetical+List+of+All+Defined+Terms+in+Blueprint+v2.0). {#tbl-mapping-pht-dssc}

## The lakehouse architecture as the _de facto_ standard for populating data stations
The PHT architecture does not specify _how_ the data stations should be populated with data. Also the DSB2 only describes how the 'Data, Services and Offerings descriptions' building block should provide data providers the tools to describe a data product appropriately and completely, that is, tools for metadata creation and management.

One of the key questions of this paper is to detail [the 'data conformity zone' as defined in the Cumuluz canvas](https://www.vzvz.nl/media/downloads/canvas-voor-databeschikbaarheid-v11-003pdf/download) as the functionality through which the data station is populated


## Parking lot

- Difference with data mesh: mesh of domains, federation is in the same domain. Underlying technology of a data station, however, is functionally identical
- UMCU: CQRS pattern for separately optimizing read/write patterns
- DSSC Blueprint: FL subsumed in value adding services

@tbl-types-hdp lists known examples of existing health data platform architectures along these two trade-offs.

## Glossary {#sec-glossary}

- *Data Controller* (Business Role) is the role of controlling rights over data.
- *Data Station* (Business Product) is a software application responsible for making data and their related metadata available to users under the accessibility conditions determined by applicable regulations and the related Data Controllers.
- *Directory Owner* (Business Role) is the role of being responsible for the operation of a Station Directory.
- *Personal Gateway* (Business Product) is a software application responsible for mediating the communication between Data Stations and Data Controllers. The Data Controllers are able to exercise their control over the data available in different Data Stations through the Personal Gateway.
- *Station Directory* (Business Product) is a software application responsible for indexing metadata from the reachable Data Stations, allowing users to search for data available in those stations.
- *Train* (Business Representation) represents the way data consumers interact with the data available in the Data Stations. Trains represent a particular data access request and, therefore, each train carries information about who is responsible for the request, the required data, what will be done with the data, what it expects from the station, etc.
- *Train Handler* (Business Representation) is a software application that interacts with the Stations Directory on behalf of a client to discover the availability and location of data and sends Trains to Data Stations.
- *Station Owner* (Business Role) is the role of being responsible for the operation of a Data Station.
- *Train Owner* (Business Role) is the role of using a Train Handler to send Trains to Data Stations.
- *Train Provider* (Business Role) is the role of being responsible for the creation of a specific Train, e.g. the developer of a specific analysis algorithm.
