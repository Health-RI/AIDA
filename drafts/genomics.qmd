Context:
- GA4GH
- Germline vs Somatic

Points to make:
- Where it breaks/does not work with generic Trusted Processing Environments
    - Overview of Genomics (T)PEs
- Users need to bring not only software but data into the environment
    - Balance figure (open-effective-user control-some privacy risks / closed-ineffective-central control-full privacy)
- Federated learning currently under development
    - Beacons
    - WEP/S
