  abstract = {Administrative and medical processes of the healthcare organizations are rapidly changing because of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This change demonstrates the critical impact of AI at multiple activities, particularly in medical processes related to early detection and diagnosis. Previous studies suggest that AI can raise the quality of services in the healthcare industry. AI-based technologies have reported to improve human life quality, making life easier, safer and more productive. This study presents a systematic review of academic articles on the application of AI in the healthcare sector. The review initially considered 1,988 academic articles from major scholarly databases. After a careful review, the list was filtered down to 180 articles for full analysis to present a classification framework based on four dimensions: AI-enabled healthcare benefits, challenges, methodologies, and functionalities. It was identified that AI continues to significantly outperform humans in terms of accuracy, efficiency and timely execution of medical and related administrative processes. Benefits for patients’ map directly to the relevant AI functionalities in the categories of diagnosis, treatment, consultation and health monitoring for self-management of chronic conditions. Implications for future research directions are identified in the areas of value-added healthcare services for medical decision-making, security and privacy for patient data, health monitoring features, and creative IT service delivery models using AI.},

Extant literature highlights the need for startups to equip themselves with the tools and resources to manage this turbulent transition. However, the existing frameworks propounded by fellow scholars and practitioners regarding VoD are fragmented, each covering only a few issues in the chasm. Thus, the current article proposes a new and comprehensive model for high technology-based startups. The new model emerged from an in-depth review of 128 scholarly materials and empirical data collected from 30 startups (from artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented realities, internet of things, medical, and cleantech industrial sectors). The model was piloted in three pre-startups. The model adds on the existing VoD frameworks to provide a holistic baseline for future research in this field by presenting different challenges underlying the pre-establishment years of a company while addressing courses of action needed to overcome this perilous transition.},

The EU AI Act sets the overall regulatory framework for AI, while other legislations set social, health, and human rights standards, address the safety of technologies and the implementation of innovation, and ensure the protection and safe use of data. Regulation specifically pertaining to AI is still nascent and scarce, though a combination of data, technology, innovation, and health and human rights policy has already formed a baseline regulatory framework for AI in health. Future work should explore specific regulatory challenges, especially with respect to AI medical devices, data protection, and data enablement.},

Out of a total of 22,693 articles under review, 612 articles are included in the final analysis. The majority of articles are proof-of-concepts studies, and only 5.2\% are studies with real-life application of FL. Radiology and internal medicine are the most common specialties involved in FL. FL is robust to a variety of machine learning models and data types, with neural networks and medical imaging being the most common, respectively. We highlight the need to address the barriers to clinical translation and to assess its realworld impact in this new digital data-driven healthcare scene.},

This fragmentation leads in turn to issues such as inconsistencies in services versus payments, wastage, and notably, care delivered being less than best-practice. Despite the long-standing recognition of interoperable data as a potential solution, efforts in achieving interoperability have been disjointed and inconsistent, resulting in numerous incompatible standards, despite the widespread agreement that fewer standards would enhance interoperability. This paper introduces a framework for understanding health care data needs, discussing the challenges and opportunities of open data standards in the field. It emphasizes the necessity of acknowledging diverse data standards, each catering to specific viewpoints and needs, while proposing a categorization of health care data into three domains, each with its distinct characteristics and challenges, along with outlining overarching design requirements applicable to all domains and specific requirements unique to each domain.},
