  abstract = {In today’s Big Data world, organisations can gain a competitive edge by adopting data-driven decision-making. However, a modern data platform that is portable, resilient, and efficient is required to manage organisations’ data and support their growth. Furthermore, the change in the data management architectures has been accompanied by changes in storage formats, particularly open standard formats like Apache Hudi, Apache Iceberg, and Delta Lake. With many alternatives, organisations are unclear on how to combine these into an effective platform. Our work investigates capabilities provided by Kubernetes and other Cloud-Native software, using DataOps methodologies to build a generic data platform that follows the Data Lakehouse architecture. We define the data platform specification, architecture, and core components to build a proof of concept system. Moreover, we provide a clear implementation methodology by developing the core of the proposed platform, which are infrastructure (Kubernetes), ingestion and transport (Argo Workflows), storage (MinIO), and finally, query and processing (Dremio). We then conducted performance benchmarks using an industry-standard benchmark suite to compare cold/warm start scenarios and assess Dremio’s caching capabilities, demonstrating a 12\% median enhancement of query duration with caching.},

This change demonstrates the critical impact of AI at multiple activities, particularly in medical processes related to early detection and diagnosis. Previous studies suggest that AI can raise the quality of services in the healthcare industry. AI-based technologies have reported to improve human life quality, making life easier, safer and more productive. This study presents a systematic review of academic articles on the application of AI in the healthcare sector. The review initially considered 1,988 academic articles from major scholarly databases. After a careful review, the list was filtered down to 180 articles for full analysis to present a classification framework based on four dimensions: AI-enabled healthcare benefits, challenges, methodologies, and functionalities. It was identified that AI continues to significantly outperform humans in terms of accuracy, efficiency and timely execution of medical and related administrative processes. Benefits for patients’ map directly to the relevant AI functionalities in the categories of diagnosis, treatment, consultation and health monitoring for self-management of chronic conditions. Implications for future research directions are identified in the areas of value-added healthcare services for medical decision-making, security and privacy for patient data, health monitoring features, and creative IT service delivery models using AI.},

  abstract = {The validity of epidemiologic findings can be increased using triangulation, i.e. comparison of findings across contexts, and by having sufficiently large amounts of relevant data to analyse. However, access to data is often constrained by practical considerations and by ethico-legal and data governance restrictions. Gaining access to such data can be time-consuming due to the governance requirements associated with data access requests to institutions in different jurisdictions.DataSHIELD is a software solution that enables remote analysis without the need for data transfer (federated analysis). DataSHIELD is a scientifically mature, open-source data access and analysis platform aligned with the ‘Five Safes’ framework, the international framework governing safe research access to data. It allows real-time analysis while mitigating disclosure risk through an active multi-layer system of disclosure-preventing mechanisms. This combination of real-time remote statistical analysis, disclosure prevention mechanisms, and federation capabilities makes DataSHIELD a solution for addressing many of the technical and regulatory challenges in performing the large-scale statistical analysis of health and biomedical data. This paper describes the key components that comprise the disclosure protection system of DataSHIELD. These broadly fall into three classes: (i) system protection elements, (ii) analysis protection elements, and (iii) governance protection elements.Information about the DataSHIELD software is available in https://datashield.org/ and https://github.com/datashield.},

  abstract = {Oncology patients often face complex choices between treatment regimens with different risk-benefit ratios. The 4D PICTURE (Producing Improved Cancer Outcomes Through User-Centered Research) project aims to support patients, their families, and clinicians with these complex decisions by developing data-driven decision support tools (DSTs) for patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma as part of care path redesign using a methodology called MetroMapping. There are myriad ethical issues to consider as the project will create data-driven prognostic models and develop conversation tools using artificial intelligence while including patient perspectives by setting up boards of experiential experts in 8 different countries. This paper aims to review the key ethical challenges related to the design and development of DSTs in oncology. To explore the ethics of DSTs in cancer care, the project adopted the Embedded Ethics approach—embedding ethicists into research teams to sensitize team members to ethical aspects and assist in reflecting on those aspects throughout the project. We conducted what we call an embedded review of the project drawing from key literature on topics related to the different work packages of the 4D PICTURE project, whereas the analysis was an iterative process involving discussions with researchers in the project. Our review identified 13 key ethical challenges related to the development of DSTs and the redesigning of care paths for more personalized cancer care. Several ethical aspects were related to general potential issues of data bias and privacy but prompted specific research questions, for instance, about the inclusion of certain demographic variables in models. Design methodology in the 4D PICTURE project can provide insights related to design justice, a novel consideration in health care DSTs. Ethical points of attention related to health care policy, such as cost-effectiveness, financial sustainability, and environmental impact, were also identified, along with challenges in the research process itself, emphasizing the importance of epistemic justice, the role of embedded ethicists, and psychological safety. This viewpoint highlights ethical aspects previously neglected in the digital health ethics literature and zooms in on real-world challenges in an ongoing project. It underscores the need for researchers and leaders in data-driven medical research projects to address ethical challenges beyond the scientific core of the project. More generally, our tailored review approach provides a model for embedding ethics into large data-driven oncology research projects from the start, which helps ensure that technological innovations are designed and developed in an appropriate and patient-centered manner.},

  abstract = {BackgroundHealth data has become an abundant and rich source of information that can be leveraged for clinical trials. Health Level Seven (HL7) provides standards for health care data, while the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) provides standards for research data. Bridging these worlds and leveraging health data has the potential to enhance knowledge and data quality, while reducing delays and cost in clinical trials.Objectives The aim was to provide an overview of the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) to CDISC Joint Mapping Implementation Guide (IG) development. The ultimate aim is to increase awareness of this rich resource.MethodsA gap analysis was performed to assess the possibility and feasibility of mapping from FHIR to the CDISC’s Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) and Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization (CDASH) standards. The mapping of CDISC domains commenced using FHIRPath, a path-based navigation and extraction language. The domains mapped were Medical History (MH), Concomitant Medications (CM), Procedures (PR), Vital Signs (VS), Laboratory (LB), Adverse Events (AE), and Demographics (DM). The proposed mappings were evaluated through a formal review process.ResultsThe review process consisted of a CDISC Internal Review and a simultaneous CDISC Public Review and HL7 Ballot Review.\&nbsp; A total of 363 comments were obtained from the following reviews: 1) CDISC Internal Review (268), and 2) simultaneous Public Review (95) - CDISC (37), HL7 (58). The predominant gathered in the review included mapping updates, terminology, and requests for greater detail.ConclusionThe HL7 FHIR®\&nbsp;to CDISC Joint Mapping Implementation Guide (IG) provides a rich resource for bridging health care and research standards that can be used with CDISC LB to LOINC mapping guide for leveraging real-world data for clinical trials. The guide assists stakeholders in utilizing health data through the HL7 FHIR® resources to CDISC, CDASH, and SDTM variables. As the community uses this resource, it will continue to mature and potentially expand into new domains.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The FAIR principles recommend the use of controlled vocabularies, such as ontologies, to define data and metadata concepts. Ontologies are currently modelled following different approaches, sometimes describing conflicting definitions of the same concepts, which can affect interoperability. To cope with that, prior literature suggests organising ontologies in levels, where domain specific (low-level) ontologies are grounded in domain independent high-level ontologies (i.e., foundational ontologies). In this level-based organisation, foundational ontologies work as translators of intended meaning, thus improving interoperability. Despite their considerable acceptance in biomedical research, there are very few studies testing foundational ontologies. This paper describes a systematic literature mapping that was conducted to understand how foundational ontologies are used in biomedical research and to find empirical evidence supporting their claimed (dis)advantages.                                         Results               From a set of 79 selected papers, we identified that foundational ontologies are used for several purposes: ontology construction, repair, mapping, and ontology-based data analysis. Foundational ontologies are claimed to improve interoperability, enhance reasoning, speed up ontology development and facilitate maintainability. The complexity of using foundational ontologies is the most commonly cited downside. Despite being used for several purposes, there were hardly any experiments (1 paper) testing the claims for or against the use of foundational ontologies. In the subset of 49 papers that describe the development of an ontology, it was observed a low adherence to ontology construction (16 papers) and ontology evaluation formal methods (4 papers).                                         Conclusion               Our findings have two main implications. First, the lack of empirical evidence about the use of foundational ontologies indicates a need for evaluating the use of such artefacts in biomedical research. Second, the low adherence to formal methods illustrates how the field could benefit from a more systematic approach when dealing with the development and evaluation of ontologies. The understanding of how foundational ontologies are used in the biomedical field can drive future research towards the improvement of ontologies and, consequently, data FAIRness. The adoption of formal methods can impact the quality and sustainability of ontologies, and reusing these methods from other fields is encouraged.},

Overall, these BYODs intend to foster collaboration between different types of stakeholders involved in data management, curation, and reuse (e.g. domain experts, trainers, developers, data owners, data analysts, FAIR experts). The BYODs also serve as an opportunity to learn what kind of support for FAIRification is needed from different communities and to develop teaching materials based on practical examples and experience. In this paper, we detail the three different structures of the BYODs and describe examples of early BYODs related to plant breeding data, and rare disease registries and biobanks, which have shaped the structure of the workshops. We discuss the latest insights into making BYODs more productive by leveraging our almost ten years of training experience in these workshops, including successes and encountered challenges. Finally, we examine how the participants’ feedback has motivated the research on FAIR, including the development of workflows and software.},

  abstract = {In recent years, as newer technologies have evolved around the healthcare ecosystem, more and more data have been generated. Advanced analytics could power the data collected from numerous sources, both from healthcare institutions, or generated by individuals themselves via apps and devices, and lead to innovations in treatment and diagnosis of diseases; improve the care given to the patient; and empower citizens to participate in the decision-making process regarding their own health and well-being. However, the sensitive nature of the health data prohibits healthcare organizations from sharing the data. The Personal Health Train (PHT) is a novel approach, aiming to establish a distributed data analytics infrastructure enabling the (re)use of distributed healthcare data, while data owners stay in control of their own data. The main principle of the PHT is that data remain in their original location, and analytical tasks visit data sources and execute the tasks. The PHT provides a distributed, flexible approach to use data in a network of participants, incorporating the FAIR principles. It facilitates the responsible use of sensitive and/or personal data by adopting international principles and regulations. This paper presents the concepts and main components of the PHT and demonstrates how it complies with FAIR principles.},

However, in traditional data analysis systems, data need to be moved to a central processing unit that performs analyses, which may be undesirable, e.g. due to privacy regulations in case these data contain personal information. This paper discusses the Personal Health Train (PHT) approach in which data processing is brought to the (personal health) data rather than the other way around, allowing (private) data accessed to be controlled, and to observe ethical and legal concerns. This paper introduces the PHT architecture and discusses the data staging solution that allows processing to be delegated to components spawned in a private cloud environment in case the (health) organisation hosting the data has limited resources to execute the required processing. This paper shows the feasibility and suitability of the solution with a relatively simple, yet representative, case study of data analysis of Covid-19 infections, which is performed by components that are created on demand and run in the Amazon Web Services platform. This paper also shows that the performance of our solution is acceptable, and that our solution is scalable. This paper demonstrates that the PHT approach enables data analysis with controlled access, preserving privacy and complying with regulations such as GDPR, while the solution is deployed in a private cloud environment.},

  abstract = {Advancements in data acquisition and computational methods are generating a large amount of heterogeneous biomedical data from diagnostic domains such as clinical imaging, pathology, and next-generation sequencing (NGS), which help characterize individual differences in patients. However, this information needs to be available and suitable to promote and support scientific research and technological development, supporting the effective adoption of the precision medicine approach in clinical practice.~Digital biobanks can catalyze this process, facilitating the sharing of curated and standardized imaging data, clinical, pathological and molecular data, crucial to enable the development of a comprehensive and personalized data-driven diagnostic approach in disease management and fostering the development of computational predictive models.~This work aims to frame this perspective, first by evaluating the state of standardization of individual diagnostic domains and then by identifying challenges and proposing a possible solution towards an integrative approach that can guarantee the suitability of information that can be shared through a digital biobank.~Our analysis of the state of the art shows the presence and use of reference standards in biobanks and, generally, digital repositories for each specific domain. Despite this, standardization to guarantee the integration and reproducibility of the numerical descriptors generated by each domain, e.g. radiomic, pathomic and -omic features, is still an open challenge. Based on specific use cases and scenarios, an integration model, based on the JSON format, is proposed that can help address this problem.~Ultimately, this work shows how, with specific standardization and promotion efforts, the digital biobank model can become an enabling technology for the comprehensive study of diseases and the effective development of data-driven technologies at the service of precision medicine.},

  abstract = {Background To receive the best care, people share their health data (HD) with their health practitioners (known as sharing HD for primary purposes). However, during the past two decades, sharing for other (i.e., secondary) purposes has become of great importance in numerous fields, including public health, personalized medicine, research, and development. We aimed to conduct the first comprehensive overview of all studies that investigated people's HD sharing attitudes—along with associated barriers/motivators and significant influencing factors—for all data types and across both primary and secondary uses. Methods We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, and CINAHL for relevant studies published in English between database inception and February 28, 2023, using a predefined set of keywords. Studies were included, regardless of their design, if they reported outcomes related to attitudes towards sharing HD. We extracted key data from the included studies, including the type of HD involved and findings related to: HD sharing attitudes (either in general or depending on type of data/user); barriers/motivators/benefits/concerns of the study participants; and sociodemographic and other variables that could impact HD sharing behaviour. The qualitative synthesis was conducted by dividing the studies according to the data type (resulting in five subgroups) as well as the purpose the data sharing was focused on (primary, secondary or both). The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of non-randomised studies. This work was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023413822. Findings Of 2109 studies identified through our search, 116 were included in the qualitative synthesis, yielding a total of 228,501 participants and various types of HD represented: person-generated HD (n~=~17 studies and 10,771 participants), personal HD in general (n~=~69 studies and 117,054 participants), Biobank data (n~=~7 studies and 27,073 participants), genomic data (n~=~13 studies and 54,716 participants), and miscellaneous data (n~=~10 studies and 18,887 participants). The majority of studies had a moderate level of quality (83 [71.6\%] of 116 studies), but varying levels of quality were observed across the included studies. Overall, studies suggest that sharing intentions for primary purposes were observed to be high regardless of data type, and it was higher than sharing intentions for secondary purposes. Sharing for secondary purposes yielded variable findings, where both the highest and the lowest intention rates were observed in the case of studies that explored sharing biobank data (98\% and 10\%, respectively). Several influencing factors on sharing intentions were identified, such as the type of data recipient, data, consent. Further, concerns related to data sharing that were found to be mutual for all data types included privacy, security, and data access/control, while the perceived benefits included those related to improvements in healthcare. Findings regarding attitudes towards sharing varied significantly across sociodemographic factors and depended on data type and type of use. In most cases, these findings were derived from single studies and therefore warrant confirmations from additional studies. Interpretation Sharing health data is a complex issue that is influenced by various factors (the type of health data, the intended use, the data recipient, among others) and these insights could be used to overcome barriers, address people's concerns, and focus on spreading awareness about the data sharing process and benefits. Funding None.},

  abstract = {Big data and machine learning applications focus on retrieving data on a central location for analysis. However, healthcare data can be sensitive in nature and as such difficult to share and make use for secondary purposes. Healthcare vendors are restricted to share data without proper consent from the patient. There is a rising awareness among individual patients as well regarding sharing their personal information due to ethical, legal and societal problems. The current data-sharing platforms in healthcare do not sufficiently handle these issues. The rationale of the Personal Health Train (PHT) approach shifts the focus from sharing data to sharing processing/analysis applications and their respective results. A prerequisite of the PHT-infrastructure is that the data is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). The aim of the paper is to describe a methodology of finding the number of patients diagnosed with hypertension and calculate cohort statistics in a privacy-preserving federated manner. The whole process completes without individual patient data leaving the source. For this, we rely on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard.},

  abstract = {Background: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into health care has the potential to transform the industry, but it also raises ethical, regulatory, and safety concerns. This review paper provides an in-depth examination of the benefits and risks associated with AI in health care, with a focus on issues like biases, transparency, data privacy, and safety. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of incorporating AI in health care. This assessment centers on the potential biases in AI algorithms, transparency challenges, data privacy issues, and safety risks in health care settings. Methods: Studies included in this review were selected based on their relevance to AI applications in health care, focusing on ethical, regulatory, and safety considerations. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed articles, reviews, and relevant research papers published in English. Exclusion criteria included non–peer-reviewed articles, editorials, and studies not directly related to AI in health care. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across 8 databases: OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, OVID PsycINFO, EBSCO CINAHL Plus with Full Text, ProQuest Sociological Abstracts, ProQuest Philosopher’s Index, ProQuest Advanced Technologies \&amp; Aerospace, and Wiley Cochrane Library. The search was last updated on June 23, 2023. Results were synthesized using qualitative methods to identify key themes and findings related to the benefits and risks of AI in health care. Results: The literature search yielded 8796 articles. After removing duplicates and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 44 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. This review highlights the significant promise that AI holds in health care, such as enhancing health care delivery by providing more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and efficient resource allocation. However, persistent concerns remain, including biases ingrained in AI algorithms, a lack of transparency in decision-making, potential compromises of patient data privacy, and safety risks associated with AI implementation in clinical settings. Conclusions: In conclusion, while AI presents the opportunity for a health care revolution, it is imperative to address the ethical, regulatory, and safety challenges linked to its integration. Proactive measures are required to ensure that AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly, striking a balance between innovation and the safeguarding of patient well-being.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose: Access to healthcare data is indispensable for scientific progress and innovation. Sharing healthcare data is time-consuming and notoriously difficult due to privacy and regulatory concerns. The Personal Health Train (PHT) provides a privacy-by-design infrastructure connecting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data sources and allows distributed data analysis and machine learning. Patient data never leaves a healthcare institute. Materials and methods: Lung cancer patient-specific databases (tumor staging and post-treatment survival information) of oncology departments were translated according to a FAIR data model and stored locally in a graph database. Software was installed locally to enable deployment of distributed machine learning algorithms via a central server. Algorithms (MATLAB, code and documentation publicly available) are patient privacy-preserving as only summary statistics and regression coefficients are exchanged with the central server. A logistic regression model to predict post-treatment two-year survival was trained and evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), root mean square prediction error (RMSE) and calibration plots. Results: In 4 months, we connected databases with 23 203 patient cases across 8 healthcare institutes in 5 countries (Amsterdam, Cardiff, Maastricht, Manchester, Nijmegen, Rome, Rotterdam, Shanghai) using the PHT. Summary statistics were computed across databases. A distributed logistic regression model predicting post-treatment two-year survival was trained on 14 810 patients treated between 1978 and 2011 and validated on 8 393 patients treated between 2012 and 2015. Conclusion: The PHT infrastructure demonstrably overcomes patient privacy barriers to healthcare data sharing and enables fast data analyses across multiple institutes from different countries with different regulatory regimens. This infrastructure promotes global evidence-based medicine while prioritizing patient privacy.},

  abstract = {The integration and exchange of information among health organizations and system providers are currently regarded as a challenge. Each organization usually has an internal ecosystem and a proprietary way to store electronic health records of the patient’s history. Recent research explores the advantages of an integrated ecosystem by exchanging information between the different inpatient care actors. Many efforts seek quality in health care, economy, and sustainability in process management. Some examples are reducing medical errors, disease control and monitoring, individualized patient care, and avoiding duplicate and fragmented entries in the electronic medical record. Likewise, some studies showed technologies to achieve this goal effectively and efficiently, with the ability to interoperate data, allowing the interpretation and use of health information. To that end, semantic interoperability aims to share data among all the sectors in the organization, clinicians, nurses, lab, the entire hospital. Therefore, avoiding data silos and keep data regardless of vendors, to exchange the information across organizational boundaries. This study presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of semantic interoperability in electronic health records. We searched seven databases of articles published between 2010 to September 2020. We showed the most chosen scenarios, technologies, and tools employed to solve interoperability problems, and we propose a taxonomy around semantic interoperability in health records. Also, we presented the main approaches to solve the exchange problem of legacy and heterogeneous data across healthcare organizations.},

It aims to ensure a coherent and unambiguous exchange, use, and reuse of health information among different systems and applications. In the context of the EUCAIM (Cancer Image Europe) project, semantic interoperability among various heterogeneous cancer image data models is required to support the communication, integration, and sharing of data in a standardized and structured way. For this purpose, hyper-ontology is developed as a common semantic metamodel that bridges the disparate imaging and clinical knowledge of the various repositories in EUCAIM and supports their integration. EUCAIM’s hyper-ontology is also an application-based ontology targeted for federated semantic querying and image annotation. To facilitate the hyper-ontology building process and ensure the extensibility of the ontology model, an iterative hybrid well-founded approach that divides the ontology structure into layers and modules is established.},

Even after their successful integration into clinical practice, ML/AI algorithms should be continuously monitored and updated to ensure their long-term safety and effectiveness. To bring AI into maturity in clinical care, we advocate for the creation of hospital units responsible for quality assurance and improvement of these algorithms, which we refer to as “AI-QI” units. We discuss how tools that have long been used in hospital quality assurance and quality improvement can be adapted to monitor static ML algorithms. On the other hand, procedures for continual model updating are still nascent. We highlight key considerations when choosing between existing methods and opportunities for methodological innovation.},

Since previous reviews only partly address data lakes in the healthcare domain, a systematic literature review on this topic is missing. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of applications in the healthcare domain that benefit from data lakes. We review the literature and structure it according to data sources and players, and we identify applications and future research needs of data lakes in the healthcare domain. Overall, it turned out that all players could benefit from the capabilities of data lakes. We found that data lakes are currently not broadly implemented in the field, and the viewpoint of hospital operators and healthcare insurers seems to be an underresearched topic compared to the other players.},

  abstract = {PurposeMany institutions throughout the world have launched precision medicine initiatives in oncology, and a large amount of clinical and genomic data is being produced. Although there have been attempts at data sharing with the community, initiatives are still limited. In this context, a French task force composed of Integrated Cancer Research Sites (SIRICs), comprehensive cancer centers from the Unicancer network (one of Europe's largest cancer research organization), and university hospitals launched an initiative to improve and accelerate retrospective and prospective clinical and genomic data sharing in oncology.Materials and MethodsFor 5 years, the OSIRIS group has worked on structuring data and identifying technical solutions for collecting and sharing them. The group used a multidisciplinary approach that included weekly scientific and technical meetings over several months to foster a national consensus on a minimal data set.ResultsThe resulting OSIRIS set and event-based data model, which is able to capture the disease course, was built with 67 clinical and 65 omics items. The group made it compatible with the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format to maximize interoperability. The OSIRIS set was reviewed, approved by a National Plan Strategic Committee, and freely released to the community. A proof-of-concept study was carried out to put the OSIRIS set and Common Data Model into practice using a cohort of 300 patients.ConclusionUsing a national and bottom-up approach, the OSIRIS group has defined a model including a minimal set of clinical and genomic data that can be used to accelerate data sharing produced in oncology. The model relies on clear and formally defined terminologies and, as such, may also benefit the larger international community.},

In contrast to traditional ‘schema-on-write’ approaches such as data warehouses, data lakes are repositories storing raw data in its original formats and providing a common access interface. Despite the strong interest raised from both academia and industry, there is a large body of ambiguity regarding the definition, functions and available technologies for data lakes. A complete, coherent picture of data lake challenges and solutions is still missing. This survey reviews the development, architectures, and systems of data lakes. We provide a comprehensive overview of research questions for designing and building data lakes. We classify the existing approaches and systems based on their provided functions for data lakes, which makes this survey a useful technical reference for designing, implementing and deploying data lakes. We hope that the thorough comparison of existing solutions and the discussion of open research challenges in this survey will motivate the future development of data lake research and practice.},

  abstract = {Efficient big data management is a dire necessity to manage the exponential growth in data generated by digital information systems to produce usable knowledge. Structured databases, data lakes, and warehouses have each provided a solution with varying degrees of success. However, a new and superior solution, the data Lakehouse, has emerged to extract actionable insights from unstructured data ingested from distributed sources. By combining the strengths of data warehouses and data lakes, the data Lakehouse can process and merge data quickly while ingesting and storing high-speed unstructured data with post-storage transformation and analytics capabilities. The Lakehouse architecture offers the necessary features for optimal functionality and has gained significant attention in the big data management research community. In this paper, we compare data lake, warehouse, and lakehouse systems, highlight their strengths and shortcomings, identify the desired features to handle the evolving challenges in big data management and analysis and propose an advanced data Lakehouse architecture. We also demonstrate the performance of three state-of-the-art data management systems namely HDFS data lake, Hive data warehouse, and Delta lakehouse in managing data for analytical query responses through an experimental study.},

We argue that open standards are a necessary but not sufficient condition to achieve health data interoperability. The ecosystem of open-source software needs to be considered when choosing an appropriate standard for a given context. We discuss two specific contexts, namely standardization of (1) health data for federated learning, and (2) health data sharing in low- and middle-income countries. Specific design principles, practical considerations, and implementation choices for these two contexts are described, based on ongoing work in both areas. In the case of federated learning, we observe convergence toward OMOP and FHIR, where the two standards can effectively be used side-by-side given the availability of mediators between the two. In the case of health information exchanges in low and middle-income countries, we see a strong convergence toward FHIR as the primary standard. We propose practical guidelines for context-specific adaptation of open health data standards.},

An important barrier is the lack of well-designed, vendor-neutral and future-proof infrastructures for deployment. Because current AI algorithms are very narrow in scope, it is expected that a typical hospital will deploy many algorithms concurrently. Managing stand-alone point solutions for all of these algorithms will be unmanageable. A solution to this problem is a dedicated platform for deployment of AI. Here we describe a blueprint for such a platform and the high-level design and implementation considerations of such a system that can be used clinically as well as for research and development. Close collaboration between radiologists, data scientists, software developers and experts in hospital IT as well as involvement of patients is crucial in order to successfully bring AI to the clinic.},

  abstract = {Background: Observational clinical studies play a pivotal role in advancing medical knowledge and patient healthcare. To lessen the prohibitive costs of conducting these studies and support evidence-based medicine, results emanating from these studies need to be shared and compared to one another. Current approaches for clinical study management have limitations that prohibit the effective sharing of clinical research data. Methods: The objective of this paper is to present a proposal for a clinical study architecture to not only facilitate the communication of clinical study data but also its context so that the data that is being communicated can be unambiguously understood at the receiving end. Our approach is two-fold. First we outline our methodology to map clinical data from Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium Operational Data Model (ODM) to the Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resource (FHIR) and outline the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Next, we propose two FHIR-based models, to capture the metadata and data from the clinical study, that not only facilitate the syntactic but also semantic interoperability of clinical study data. Conclusions: This work shows that our proposed FHIR resources provide a good fit to semantically enrich the ODM data. By exploiting the rich information model in FHIR, we can organise clinical data in a manner that preserves its organisation but captures its context. Our implementations demonstrate that FHIR can natively manage clinical data. Furthermore, by providing links at several levels, it improves the traversal and querying of the data. The intended benefits of this approach is more efficient and effective data exchange that ultimately will allow clinicians to switch their focus back to decision-making and evidence-based medicines.},

  abstract = {Background: Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into medical education has gained significant attention for its potential to enhance teaching and learning outcomes. However, it lacks a comprehensive study depicting the academic performance and status of AI in the medical education domain. Objective: This study aims to analyze the social patterns, productive contributors, knowledge structure, and clusters since the 21st century. Methods: Documents were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2000 to 2024. VOSviewer, Incites, and Citespace were used to analyze the bibliometric metrics, which were categorized by country, institution, authors, journals, and keywords. The variables analyzed encompassed counts, citations, H-index, impact factor, and collaboration metrics. Results: Altogether, 7534 publications were initially retrieved and 2775 were included for analysis. The annual count and citation of papers exhibited exponential trends since 2018. The United States emerged as the lead contributor due to its high productivity and recognition levels. Stanford University, Johns Hopkins University, National University of Singapore, Mayo Clinic, University of Arizona, and University of Toronto were representative institutions in their respective fields. Cureus, JMIR Medical Education, Medical Teacher, and BMC Medical Education ranked as the top four most productive journals. The resulting heat map highlighted several high-frequency keywords, including performance, education, AI, and model. The citation burst time of terms revealed that AI technologies shifted from imaging processing (2000), augmented reality (2013), and virtual reality (2016) to decision-making (2020) and model (2021). Keywords such as mortality and robotic surgery persisted into 2023, suggesting the ongoing recognition and interest in these areas. Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights and guidance for researchers who are interested in educational technology, as well as recommendations for pioneering institutions and journal submissions. Along with the rapid growth of AI, medical education is expected to gain much more benefits.},

Moreover, human multi-omics data may be privacy-sensitive and can be misused to de-anonymize and (re-)identify individuals. Hence, most biomedical data is kept in secure and protected silos. Therefore, it remains a challenge to re-use these data without infringing the privacy of the individuals from which the data were derived.

Results The Netherlands X-omics Initiative is a National Roadmap Large-Scale Research Infrastructure aiming for efficient integration of data generated within X-omics and external datasets. To facilitate this, we developed the FAIR Data Cube (FDCube), which adopts and applies the FAIR principles and helps researchers to create FAIR data and metadata, to facilitate re-use of their data, and to make their data analysis workflows transparent, and in the meantime ensure data security and privacy.},

  abstract = {With the growth of the Internet of Things and the rapid progress of social networks, everything appears to generate data. The ever-increasing number of connected devices is accompanied by a growth of the volume of data, produced at an ever-increasing rate, and this massive flow includes data types that are difficult to process using standard database techniques. One of the most critical scenarios is healthcare, whose activities need to store and manage a variety of data types – reports written in natural language, medical images, genomic data and waveforms of vital signs – which do not have a well-defined structure. In order to benefit from this large amount of complex data, Data Lakes have recently emerged as a solution to grant central storage and flexible analysis for all types of data. However, there is no Data Lake architecture that fits all the possible scenarios, since the architecture depends heavily on the application domain and, so far, there are no Data Lake architectures that support the specific needs of the healthcare domain. This work proposes HEALER: a Data Lake architecture that effectively performs data ingestion, data storage, and data access with the aim of providing a single central repository for efficient storage of different types of healthcare data. The architecture also enables the analysis and querying of the data, which can be loaded into the Data Lake regardless of their format and type. To verify the effectiveness of the architecture, a proof-of-concept of HEALER has been developed, that allows ingestion of various data, performs waveforms processing to make them more interpretable to researchers and analysts, grants access to the saved data and allows the analysis of natural language reports. Finally we studied the performance of the system in each of its main phases: ingestion, processing, data access and analysis. The results lead us to some important considerations to be taken into account when using and configuring the system components.},

To enable access to personal data, Trusted Research Environments (TREs) (otherwise known as Safe Havens) provide safe and secure environments in which researchers can access sensitive personal data and develop AI (in particular machine learning (ML)) models. However, currently few TREs support the training of ML models in part due to a gap in the practical decision-making guidance for TREs in handling model disclosure. Specifically, the training of ML models creates a need to disclose new types of outputs from TREs. Although TREs have clear policies for the disclosure of statistical outputs, the extent to which trained models can leak personal training data once released is not well understood. Background We review, for a general audience, different types of ML models and their applicability within healthcare. We explain the outputs from training a ML model and how trained ML models can be vulnerable to external attacks to discover personal data encoded within the model. Risks We present the challenges for disclosure control of trained ML models in the context of training and exporting models from TREs. We provide insights and analyse methods that could be introduced within TREs to mitigate the risk of privacy breaches when disclosing trained models. Discussion Although specific guidelines and policies exist for statistical disclosure controls in TREs, they do not satisfactorily address these new types of output requests; i.e., trained ML models. There is significant potential for new interdisciplinary research opportunities in developing and adapting policies and tools for safely disclosing ML outputs from TREs.},

  abstract = {The emerging paradigm of data economy can constitute an unmissable and attractive opportunity for companies that aim to consider their data as valuable assets. To fully leverage this opportunity, data owners need to have specific and precise guarantees regarding the protection of data they share from unauthorized access, but also from their misuse. Thus, it becomes crucial to provide mechanisms for secure and trusted data sharing capable of protecting data ownership rights and specifying agreed-upon methods of use. In this sense, data space technology can represent a promising and innovative solution in data management that aims to promote effective and trusted data exchange and sharing. By providing standardized technologies and legal frameworks, data spaces seek to eliminate barriers to data sharing among companies and organizations and, ultimately, fostering the development of innovative value-added services. By promoting interoperability and data sovereignty, data spaces play a crucial role in enhancing collaboration and innovation in the data economy. In this paper, the key European initiatives are collected and organized, with the goal of identifying the most recent advances in the direction of harmonizing the specifications, to facilitate the seamless integration between different solutions and foster secure, flexible and scalable data spaces implementations. The results of this study provide guidelines that can support data space designers in driving the choice of the most proper technical specifications to adopt, among the available open-source solutions.},

  abstract = {Relational Database Management Systems designed for Online Analytical Processing (RDBMS-OLAP) have been foundational to democratizing data and enabling analytical use cases such as business intelligence and reporting for many years. However, RDBMS-OLAP systems present some well-known challenges. They are primarily optimized only for relational workloads, lead to proliferation of data copies which can become unmanageable, and since the data is stored in proprietary formats, it can lead to vendor lock-in, restricting access to engines, tools, and capabilities beyond what the vendor offers. As the demand for data-driven decision making surges, the need for a more robust data architecture to address these challenges becomes ever more critical. Cloud data lakes have addressed some of the shortcomings of RDBMS-OLAP systems, but they present their own set of challenges. More recently, organizations have often followed a two-tier architectural approach to take advantage of both these platforms, leveraging both cloud data lakes and RDBMS-OLAP systems. However, this approach brings additional challenges, complexities, and overhead. This paper discusses how a data lakehouse, a new architectural approach, achieves the same benefits of an RDBMS-OLAP and cloud data lake combined, while also providing additional advantages. We take today's data warehousing and break it down into implementation independent components, capabilities, and practices. We then take these aspects and show how a lakehouse architecture satisfies them. Then, we go a step further and discuss what additional capabilities and benefits a lakehouse architecture provides over an RDBMS-OLAP.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The ability to use clinical and research data at scale is central to hopes for data-driven medicine. However, in using such data researchers often encounter hurdles–both technical, such as differing data security requirements, and social, such as the terms of informed consent, legal requirements and patient and public trust. Federated or distributed data networks have been proposed and adopted in response to these hurdles. However, to date there has been little consideration of how FDNs respond to both technical and social constraints on data use. In this Perspective we propose an approach to thinking about data in terms that make it easier to navigate the health data space and understand the value of differing approaches to data collection, storage and sharing. We set out a {$<$}italic{$>$}socio-technical{$<$}/italic{$>$} model of data systems that we call the “Concentric Circles View” (CCV) of data-relationships. The aim is to enable a consistent understanding of the fit between the local relationships within which data are produced and the extended socio-technical systems that enable their use. The paper suggests this model can help understand and tackle challenges associated with the use of real-world data in the health setting. We use the model to understand not only how but {$<$}italic{$>$}why{$<$}/italic{$>$} federated networks may be well placed to address emerging issues and adapt to the evolving needs of health research for patient benefit. We conclude that the CCV provides a useful model with broader application in mapping, understanding, and tackling the major challenges associated with using real world data in the health setting.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

For small dataframes, the TPCH Benchmarking DATs does not show significant differences, while for the Synthetic DATs, Polars performs significantly better. We identified strong positive correlations between energy usage and execution time, as well as memory usage for Pandas, while Polars did not show significant memory usage correlations for the majority of runs. There is a significantly negative correlation between energy usage and CPU usage for Pandas. Conclusions. We recommend using Polars for energy-efficient and fast data analysis, emphasizing the importance of CPU core utilization in library selection.

Existing research has focused either on preventing poisoning attacks from users or on concealing the local model updates from the server, but not both. However, integrating these two lines of research remains a crucial challenge since they often conflict with one another with respect to the threat model. In this work, we develop a principle framework that offers both privacy guarantees for users and detection against poisoning attacks from them. With a new threat model that includes both an honest-but-curious server and malicious users, we first propose a secure aggregation protocol using homomorphic encryption for the server to combine local model updates in a private manner. Then, a zero-knowledge proof protocol is leveraged to shift the task of detecting attacks in the local models from the server to the users. The key observation here is that the server no longer needs access to the local models for attack detection. Therefore, our framework enables the central server to identify poisoned model updates without violating the privacy guarantees of secure aggregation.},

  abstract = {The requirement for specialization in data management systems has evolved faster than our software development practices. After decades of organic growth, this situation has created a siloed landscape composed of hundreds of products developed and maintained as monoliths, with limited reuse between systems. This fragmentation has resulted in developers often reinventing the wheel, increased maintenance costs, and slowed down innovation. It has also affected the end users, who are often required to learn the idiosyncrasies of dozens of incompatible SQL and non-SQL API dialects, and settle for systems with incomplete functionality and inconsistent semantics. In this vision paper, considering the recent popularity of open source projects aimed at standardizing different aspects of the data stack, we advocate for a paradigm shift in how data management systems are designed. We believe that by decomposing these into a modular stack of reusable components, development can be streamlined while creating a more consistent experience for users. Towards that goal, we describe the state-ofthe-art, principal open source technologies, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will foster collaboration, motivate further research, and promote a more composable future for data management.},

Data is collected all over the world and needs to be integrated and made available to other researchers quickly. However, the various heterogeneous information systems that are used in hospitals can result in fragmentation of health data over multiple data ‘silos’ that are not interoperable for analysis. Consequently, clinical observations in hospitalised patients are not prepared to be reused efficiently and timely. There is a need to adapt the research data management in hospitals to make COVID-19 observational patient data machine actionable, i.e. more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) for humans and machines. We therefore applied the FAIR principles in the hospital to make patient data more FAIR.},

It further defines procedures for the secondary use of electronic health data for research and development. Although this planned legislation is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, implementation approaches could potentially result in centralised data silos that pose data privacy and security risks for individuals. To address this concern, we propose federated personal health data spaces, a novel architecture for storing, managing, and sharing personal electronic health records that puts citizens at the centre-both conceptually and technologically. The proposed architecture puts citizens in control by storing personal health data on a combination of personal devices rather than in centralised data silos. We describe how this federated architecture fits within the EHDS and can enable the same features as centralised systems while protecting the privacy of citizens. We further argue that increased privacy and control do not contradict the use of electronic health data for research and development. Instead, data sovereignty and transparency encourage active participation in studies and data sharing. This combination of privacy-by-design and transparent, privacy-preserving data sharing can enable health-care leaders to break the privacy-exploitation barrier, which currently limits the secondary use of health data in many cases.},

Furthermore, there is currently no standardized, weighted evaluation scheme for a fair comparison of FL frameworks that would support the selection of a suitable FL framework. This study addresses these research gaps by conducting a comparative analysis of 15 individual open-source FL frameworks filtered by two selection criteria, using the literature review methodology proposed by Webster and Watson. These framework candidates are compared using a novel scoring schema with 15 qualitative and quantitative evaluation criteria, focusing on features, interoperability, and user friendliness. The evaluation results show that the FL framework Flower outperforms its peers with an overall score of 84.75\%, while Fedlearner lags behind with a total score of 24.75\%. The proposed comparison suite offers valuable initial guidance for practitioners and researchers in selecting an FL framework for the design and development of FL-driven systems. In addition, the FL framework comparison suite is designed to be adaptable and extendable accommodating the inclusion of new FL frameworks and evolving requirements.},

It is often overcome by utilizing ETL processes resulting in data warehouses, which ensure common data models for interoperability. Unfortunately, the achieved interoperability is usually limited to an institutional level. The broad solution space to achieve interoperability with different health data standards is part of the problem, resulting in different standards used at various institutions. For cross-institutional use cases like federated feasibility queries, the issue of heterogeneity is reintroduced. This work showcases how the existing German infrastructure for federated feasibility queries based on Hl7 FHIR can be extended to support openEHR without further data transformation. By utilizing an intermediate query format that can be transferred to FHIR Search, CQL, and AQL.},

  abstract = {In the context of data analytics, so-called lakehouses refer to novel variants of data platforms that attempt to combine characteristics of data warehouses and data lakes. In this way, lakehouses promise to simplify enterprise analytics architectures, which often suffer from high operational costs, slow analytical processes and further shortcomings resulting from data replication. However, different views and notions on the lakehouse paradigm exist, which are commonly driven by individual technologies and varying analytical use cases. Therefore, it remains unclear what challenges lakehouses address, how they can be characterized and which technologies can be leveraged to implement them. This paper addresses these issues by providing an extensive overview of concepts and technologies that are related to the lakehouse paradigm and by outlining lakehouses as a distinct architectural approach for data platforms. Concepts and technologies from literature with regard to lakehouses are discussed, based on which a conceptual foundation for lakehouses is established. In addition, several popular technologies are evaluated regarding their suitability for the building of lakehouses. All findings are supported and demonstrated with the help of a representative analytics scenario. Typical challenges of conventional data platforms are identified, a new, sharper definition for lakehouses is proposed and technical requirements for lakehouses are derived. As part of an evaluation, these requirements are applied to several popular technologies, of which frameworks for data lakes turn out to be particularly helpful for the construction of lakehouses. Our work provides an overview of the state of the art and a conceptual foundation for the lakehouse paradigm, which can support future research.},

However, dominant DR thinking takes a technological view of the IT artifact, paying scant attention to its shaping by the organizational context. Consequently, existing DR methods focus on building the artifact and relegate evaluation to a subsequent and separate phase. They value technological rigor at the cost of organizational relevance, and fail to recognize that the artifact emerges from interaction with the organizational context even when its initial design is guided by the researchers' intent. We propose action design research (ADR) as a new DR method to address this problem. ADR reflects the premise that IT artifacts are ensembles shaped by the organizational context during development and use. The method conceptualizes the research process as containing the inseparable and inherently interwoven activities of building the IT artifact, intervening in the organization, and evaluating it concurrently. The essay describes the stages of ADR and associated principles that encapsulate its underlying beliefs and values. We illustrate ADR through a case of competence management at Volvo IT.},

  abstract = {Several studies underscore the potential of deep learning in identifying complex patterns, leading to diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Identifying sufficiently large and diverse datasets, required for training, is a significant challenge in medicine and can rarely be found in individual institutions. Multi-institutional collaborations based on centrally-shared patient data face privacy and ownership challenges. Federated learning is a novel paradigm for data-private multi-institutional collaborations, where model-learning leverages all available data without sharing data between institutions, by distributing the model-training to the data-owners and aggregating their results. We show that federated learning among 10 institutions results in models reaching 99\% of the model quality achieved with centralized data, and evaluate generalizability on data from institutions outside the federation. We further investigate the effects of data distribution across collaborating institutions on model quality and learning patterns, indicating that increased access to data through data private multi-institutional collaborations can benefit model quality more than the errors introduced by the collaborative method. Finally, we compare with other collaborative-learning approaches demonstrating the superiority of federated learning, and discuss practical implementation considerations. Clinical adoption of federated learning is expected to lead to models trained on datasets of unprecedented size, hence have a catalytic impact towards precision/personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {Background: Data models are crucial for clinical research as they enable researchers to fully use the vast amount of clinical data stored in medical systems. Standardized data and well-defined relationships between data points are necessary to guarantee semantic interoperability. Using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for clinical data representation would be a practical methodology to enhance and accelerate interoperability and data availability for research. Objective: This research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and current landscape in FHIR-based data models and structures. In addition, we intend to identify and discuss the tools, resources, limitations, and other critical aspects mentioned in the selected research papers. Methods: To ensure the extraction of reliable results, we followed the instructions of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. We analyzed the indexed articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. After identifying, extracting, and assessing the quality and relevance of the articles, we synthesized the extracted data to identify common patterns, themes, and variations in the use of FHIR-based data models and structures across different studies. Results: On the basis of the reviewed articles, we could identify 2 main themes: dynamic (pipeline-based) and static data models. The articles were also categorized into health care use cases, including chronic diseases, COVID-19 and infectious diseases, cancer research, acute or intensive care, random and general medical notes, and other conditions. Furthermore, we summarized the important or common tools and approaches of the selected papers. These items included FHIR-based tools and frameworks, machine learning approaches, and data storage and security. The most common resource was “Observation” followed by “Condition” and “Patient.” The limitations and challenges of developing data models were categorized based on the issues of data integration, interoperability, standardization, performance, and scalability or generalizability. Conclusions: FHIR serves as a highly promising interoperability standard for developing real-world health care apps. The implementation of FHIR modeling for electronic health record data facilitates the integration, transmission, and analysis of data while also advancing translational research and phenotyping. Generally, FHIR-based exports of local data repositories improve data interoperability for systems and data warehouses across different settings. However, ongoing efforts to address existing limitations and challenges are essential for the successful implementation and integration of FHIR data models.},

In our integrated workflow, the client systems (including order placer, scheduler, imaging modality, viewer, and report creator) use standard FHIR and DICOMweb APIs. The proposed scheme also facilitates the creation of reports formatted as standard FHIR resources. This paper leverages W3C Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to record the image graphic annotations, and encapsulates the SVG image annotation in FHIR observation. FHIR DiagnosticReports and Observations are used to encapsulate reports, findings, and annotations, thereby facilitating the implementation and integration of the scheme within existing structures. The proposed scheme also provides the potential to make it possible to convert results of Computer Aided Detection/Diagnosis from medical images into FHIR DiagnosticReports and Observations to be stored on a FHIR server. The resulting web-based solution uses FHIR XML and/or JSON data to record and exchange information related to imaging workflow. It can also be used to store imaging reports, findings, and annotations linked to the images using the DICOM WADO-RS protocol. As a result, it is possible to integrate all information that is created in medical imaging workflow. Finally, the proposed scheme is easily integrated with other FHIR systems.},

The present paper introduces the set of concepts used to describe the European data sources involved in the ConcePTION project and illustrates the ConcePTION Common Data Model (CDM), which serves as the keystone of the federated ConcePTION network. Based on data availability and content analysis of 21 European data sources, the ConcePTION CDM has been structured with six tables designed to capture data from routine healthcare, three tables for data from public health surveillance activities, three curated tables for derived data on population (e.g., observation time and mother‐child linkage), plus four metadata tables. By its first anniversary, the ConcePTION CDM has enabled 13 data sources to run common scripts to contribute to major European projects, demonstrating its capacity to facilitate effective and transparent deployment of distributed analytics, and its potential to address questions about utilization, effectiveness, and safety of medicines in special populations, including during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and, more broadly, in the general population.},

While RDF is proven to be machine readable and interpretable, it can be challenging for individuals without specialized background to read and understand the knowledge represented in RDF. For this reason, the semantics described in the SPHN RDF Schema are primarily defined in a user-accessible tabular format, the SPHN Dataset, before being translated into its RDF representation.

This fragmentation leads in turn to issues such as inconsistencies in services versus payments, wastage, and notably, care delivered being less than best-practice. Despite the long-standing recognition of interoperable data as a potential solution, efforts in achieving interoperability have been disjointed and inconsistent, resulting in numerous incompatible standards, despite the widespread agreement that fewer standards would enhance interoperability. This paper introduces a framework for understanding health care data needs, discussing the challenges and opportunities of open data standards in the field. It emphasizes the necessity of acknowledging diverse data standards, each catering to specific viewpoints and needs, while proposing a categorization of health care data into three domains, each with its distinct characteristics and challenges, along with outlining overarching design requirements applicable to all domains and specific requirements unique to each domain.},

Business partnerships are endemic and essential to the business of platforms, yet their role remains relatively underexplored in the literature on platformisation and platform power. This article considers the significance of partnerships in the social media ecosystem to better understand how industry platforms, and the infrastructure they build, mediate and shape platform power and governance. We argue that partners contribute to ‘platformisation’ through their collective development of business-to-business platform infrastructures. Specifically, we examine how partners have integrated social media platforms with what we call the audience economy – an exceptionally complex global and interconnected marketplace of intermediaries involved in the creation, commodification, analysis, and circulation of data audiences for purposes including but not limited to digital advertising and marketing. We determined which relationships are involved, which are exclusive or shared, and identified key ecosystem partners. Further, we found that partners build and integrate extensive infrastructures for data-sourcing and media distribution, surfacing infrastructural and strategic sources and locations, or ‘nodes’, of power in this ecosystem. The empirical findings thus highlight the significance of partnerships and partner integrations and draw attention to the powerful industry players and intermediaries that remain largely invisible.},

This study delves into the substantial role played by major technology conglomerates, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (Alphabet), in the ‘industrialisation of artificial intelligence’. This concept encapsulates the shift of AI technologies from the research and development stage to practical, real-world applications across diverse industry sectors, resulting in new dependencies and associated investments. We employ the term ‘Big AI’ to encapsulate the structural convergence of AI and Big Tech, characterised by the profound interdependence of AI with the infrastructure, resources, and investments of these major technology companies. Using a ‘technographic’ approach, our study scrutinises the infrastructural support and investments of Big Tech in the AI sector, focussing on corporate partnerships, acquisitions, and financial investments. Additionally, we conduct a detailed examination of the complete spectrum of cloud platform products and services offered by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. We demonstrate that AI is not merely an abstract idea but an actual technology stack encompassing infrastructure, models, applications, and an ecosystem of applications and companies relying on this stack. Significantly, these tech giants have seamlessly integrated all three components of the stack into their cloud offerings. Furthermore, they have developed industry-focussed solutions and marketplaces aimed at attracting third-party developers and businesses, fostering the growth of a broader AI ecosystem. This analysis underscores the intricate interdependence between AI and cloud infrastructure, emphasising the industry-specific aspects of cloud AI.},

  abstract = {Background: Although health economic evaluations (HEEs) are increasingly common for therapeutic interventions, they appear to be rare for the use of risk prediction models (PMs). Objectives: To evaluate the current state of HEEs of PMs by performing a comprehensive systematic review. Methods: Four databases were searched for HEEs of PM-based strategies. Two reviewers independently selected eligible articles. A checklist was compiled to score items focusing on general characteristics of HEEs of PMs, model characteristics and quality of HEEs, evidence on PMs typically used in the HEEs, and the specific challenges in performing HEEs of PMs. Results: After screening 791 abstracts, 171 full texts, and reference checking, 40 eligible HEEs evaluating 60 PMs were identified. In these HEEs, PM strategies were compared with current practice (n ¼ 32; 80\%), to other stratification methods for patient management (n ¼ 19; 48\%), to an extended PM (n ¼ 9; 23\%), or to alternative PMs (n ¼ 5; 13\%). The PMs guided decisions on treatment (n ¼ 42; 70\%), further testing (n ¼ 18; 30\%), or treatment prioritization (n ¼ 4; 7\%). For 36 (60\%) PMs, only a single decision threshold was evaluated. Costs of risk prediction were ignored for 28 (46\%) PMs. Uncertainty in outcomes was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analyses in 22 (55\%) HEEs. Conclusions: Despite the huge number of PMs in the medical literature, HEE of PMs remains rare. In addition, we observed great variety in their quality and methodology, which may complicate interpretation of HEE results and implementation of PMs in practice. Guidance on HEE of PMs could encourage and standardize their application and enhance methodological quality, thereby improving adequate use of PM strategies.},

To address this research gap, this research paper develops, explicates, and provides evidence for the utility of a Framework for Evaluation in Design Science (FEDS) together with a process to guide design science researchers in developing a strategy for evaluating the artefacts they develop within a DSR project. A FEDS strategy considers why, when, how, and what to evaluate. FEDS includes a two-dimensional characterisation of DSR evaluation episodes (particular evaluations), with one dimension being the functional purpose of the evaluation (formative or summative) and the other dimension being the paradigm of the evaluation (artificial or naturalistic). The FEDS evaluation design process is comprised of four steps: (1) explicate the goals of the evaluation, (2) choose the evaluation strategy or strategies, (3) determine the properties to evaluate, and (4) design the individual evaluation episode(s). The paper illustrates the framework with two examples and provides evidence of its utility via a naturalistic, summative evaluation through its use on an actual DSR project.},

  abstract = {The German initiative “National Research Data Infrastructure for Personal Health Data” (NFDI4Health) focuses on research data management in health research. It aims to foster and develop harmonized informatics standards for public health, epidemiological studies, and clinical trials, facilitating access to relevant data and metadata standards. This publication lists syntactic and semantic data standards of potential use for NFDI4Health and beyond, based on interdisciplinary meetings and workshops, mappings of study questionnaires and the NFDI4Health metadata schema, and literature search. Included are 7 syntactic, 32 semantic and 9 combined syntactic and semantic standards. In addition, 101 ISO Standards from ISO/TC 215 Health Informatics and ISO/TC 276 Biotechnology could be identified as being potentially relevant. The work emphasizes the utilization of standards for epidemiological and health research data ensuring interoperability as well as the compatibility to NFDI4Health, its use cases, and to (inter-)national efforts within these sectors. The goal is to foster collaborative and inter-sectoral work in health research and initiate a debate around the potential of using common standards.},

  abstract = {The escalating influx of data generated by networked edge devices, coupled with the growing awareness of data privacy, has restricted the traditional data analytics workflow, where the edge data are gathered by a centralized server to be further utilized by data analysts. To continue leveraging vast edge data to support various data-incentive applications, computing paradigms have promoted a transformative shift from centralized data processing to privacy-preserved distributed data processing. The need to perform data analytics on private edge data motivates federated analytics (FA), an emerging technique to support collaborative data analytics among diverse data owners without centralizing the raw data. Despite the wide applications of FA in industry and academia, a comprehensive examination of existing research efforts in FA has been notably absent. This survey aims to bridge this gap by first providing an overview of FA, elucidating key concepts, and discussing its relationship with similar concepts. We then thoroughly examine FA, including its key challenges, taxonomy, and enabling techniques. Diverse FA applications, including statistical metrics, frequency-related applications, database query operations, FL-assisting FA tasks, and other wireless network applications are then carefully reviewed. We complete the survey with several open research issues, future directions, and a comprehensive lessons learned part. This survey intends to provide a holistic understanding of the emerging FA techniques and foster the continued evolution of privacy-preserving distributed data processing in the emerging networked society.},

  abstract = {With the introduction of data protection regulations, the need for innovative privacy-preserving approaches to process and analyse sensitive data has become apparent. One approach is the Personal Health Train (PHT) that brings analysis code to the data and conducts the data processing at the data premises. However, despite its demonstrated success in various studies, the execution of external code in sensitive environments, such as hospitals, introduces new research challenges because the interactions of the code with sensitive data are often incomprehensible and lack transparency. These interactions raise concerns about potential effects on the data and increases the risk of data breaches. To address this issue, this work discusses a PHT-aligned security and audit pipeline inspired by DevSecOps principles. The automated pipeline incorporates multiple phases that detect vulnerabilities. To thoroughly study its versatility, we evaluate this pipeline in two ways. First, we deliberately introduce vulnerabilities into a PHT. Second, we apply our pipeline to five real-world PHTs, which have been utilised in real-world studies, to audit them for potential vulnerabilities. Our evaluation demonstrates that our designed pipeline successfully identifies potential vulnerabilities and can be applied to real-world studies. In compliance with the requirements of the GDPR for data management, documentation, and protection, our automated approach supports researchers using in their data-intensive work and reduces manual overhead. It can be used as a decision-making tool to assess and document potential vulnerabilities in code for data processing. Ultimately, our work contributes to an increased security and overall transparency of data processing activities within the PHT framework.},

  abstract = {The development of platforms for distributed analytics has been driven by a growing need to comply with various governance-related or legal constraints. Among these platforms, the so-called Personal Health Train (PHT) is one representative that has emerged over the recent years. However, in projects that require data from sites featuring different PHT infrastructures, institutions are facing challenges emerging from the combination of multiple PHT ecosystems, including data governance, regulatory compliance, or the modification of existing workflows. In these scenarios, the interoperability of the platforms is preferable. In this work, we introduce a conceptual framework for the technical interoperability of the PHT covering five essential requirements: Data integration, unified station identifiers, mutual metadata, aligned security protocols, and business logic. We evaluated our concept in a feasibility study that involves two distinct PHT infrastructures: PHT-meDIC and PADME. We analyzed data on leukodystrophy from patients in the University Hospitals of Tübingen and Leipzig, and patients with differential diagnoses at the University Hospital Aachen. The results of our study demonstrate the technical interoperability between these two PHT infrastructures, allowing researchers to perform analyses across the participating institutions. Our method is more space-efficient compared to the multi-homing strategy, and it shows only a minimal time overhead.},

  abstract = {Background Use of the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) allows the rapidly growing number of biomedical datasets to be optimally (re)used. An important aspect of the FAIR principles is metadata. The FAIR Data Point specifications and reference implementation have been designed as an example on how to publish metadata according to the FAIR principles. Various tools to create metadata have been created, but many of these have limitations, such as interfaces that are not intuitive, metadata that does not adhere to a common metadata schema, limited scalability, and inefficient collaboration. We aim to address these limitations in the FAIR Data Point Populator. Results The FAIR Data Point Populator consists of a GitHub workflow together with Excel templates that have tooltips, validation and documentation. The Excel templates are targeted towards non-technical users, and can be used collaboratively in online spreadsheet software. A more technical user then uses the GitHub workflow to read multiple entries in the Excel sheets, and transform it into machine readable metadata. This metadata is then automatically uploaded to a connected FAIR Data Point. We applied the FAIR Data Point Populator on the metadata of two datasets, and a patient registry. We were then able to run a query on the FAIR Data Point Index, in order to retrieve one of the datasets. Conclusion The FAIR Data Point Populator addresses several limitations of other tools. It makes creating metadata easier, ensures adherence to a common metadata schema, allows bulk creation of metadata entries and increases collaboration. As a result of this, the barrier of entry for FAIRification is lower, which enables the creation of FAIR data by more people.},

  abstract = {Objective In this article, we aim to present a new open-source Federated Learning infrastructure by conducting several proof-of-concept experiments. We seek to prove the reliability of the infrastructure to develop global models without sharing private patient data.Materials and Methods We applied the Personal Health Train (PHT) principles using the Vantage6 software to train a neural network to classify head and neck cancer patients\&amp;rsquo; distant metastasis using federated learning algorithms in a privacy preserving manner. Head and neck cancer patient data from four cohorts were assigned to two data stations. During each training iteration, model weights were averaged and sent back to central node.Results We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and model weights between the centralized and federated learning scenarios. The results showed that our federated infrastructure was able to achieve similar predicting power as in the centralized case. Different federated learning model weights aggregation methods were tested. The experiment results showed that federated learning models reached best performance when we aggregate model weights per epoch.Discussion and Conclusion PHT and FAIR data principles can efficiently calculate quality indicators in a privacy-preserving federated approach and the work can be scaled up both nationally and internationally. Despite this, application of the methodology was largely hampered by ELSI issues. However, the lessons learned from this study can provide other hospitals and researchers to adapt to the process easily and take effective measures in building quality of care infrastructures.},

  abstract = {Faced with heterogeneity of healthcare data, we propose a novel approach for harmonizing data elements (i.e., attributes) across health data standards. This approach focuses on the implicit concept that is represented by a data element. The process includes the following steps: identifying concepts, clustering similar concepts and constructing mappings between the clusters using the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) and Resource Description Framework (RDF), and enabling the creation of reusable mappings. As proof-of-concept, we applied the approach to five common health data standards - HL7 FHIR, OMOP, CDISC, Phenopackets, and openEHR, across four domains, such as demographics and diagnoses, and nine topics within those domains, such as gender and vital status. These domains and topics are selected to represent the broader range of topics in the health field. For each topic, data elements were found in the health data standards after a thorough search, resulting in the analysis of 64 data elements, identification of their underlying concepts, and development of mappings. Three use cases were implemented to demonstrate the role of data element concepts in data harmonization and data querying at varying levels of granularity. The approach helps overcome the limitations of context-dependent mappings and provides valuable insight for mapping practice within the health domain.},
